# Java Basics

This folder focuses on the foundational concepts of Java programming, including understanding the structure of a Java class and creating a simple program.

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **Structure of a Java Class**:
   - Classes serve as blueprints for objects in Java.
   - Basic structure includes:
     - `package` declaration
     - Class definition
     - `main` method (entry point of the application).

2. **Console Output**:
   - Use `System.out.println()` to print messages to the console.

## Example Code: HelloWorld.java
This program demonstrates the simplest structure of a Java program.

```java
package java_basics;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java World!");
    }
}
