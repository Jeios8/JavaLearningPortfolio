# Java Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Java Learning Portfolio! This repository is a structured and comprehensive guide to mastering Java programming, specifically tailored for the **Java SE 8 Programmer I certification (1Z0-808)**. Alongside preparing for the exam, I aim to build real-world projects and showcase my progress.

## Repository Structure
The repository is divided into sections based on the Java SE 8 Programmer I exam topics:
- **Java Basics**: [Scope of variables, class structure, creating executable applications, etc.](src/java_basics/)
- **Working with Data Types**: [Variable declaration, object lifecycle, wrapper classes, etc.](src/working_with_data_types/)
- **Using Operators and Constructs**: [Equality testing, decision constructs, switch statements, etc.](src/using_operators_and_constructs/)
- **Working with Arrays**: [One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, etc.](src/working_with_arrays/)
- **Using Loop Constructs**: [For, while, and do-while loops, break and continue statements, etc.](src/using_loop_constructs/)
- **Working with Methods and Encapsulation**: [Static methods, constructors, encapsulation principles, etc.](src/working_with_methods_encapsulation/)
- **Working with Inheritance**: [Polymorphism, casting, super and this, abstract classes, etc.](src/working_with_inheritance/)
- **Handling Exceptions**: [Checked vs. unchecked exceptions, try-catch blocks, etc.](src/handling_exceptions/)
- **Selected Java API Classes**: [String manipulation, date and time classes, Lambda expressions, etc.](src/working_with_java_api_classes/)

## Goals
- Prepare for the **Java SE 8 Programmer I certification**.
- Build a strong understanding of Java fundamentals.
- Create real-world projects to demonstrate practical applications.
